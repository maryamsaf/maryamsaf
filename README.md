Hi, I'm Maryam Safdar
Computer Engineering @ NUST Pakistan | GPU Graphics & Medical Visualization
I build real-time rendering systems for medical imaging â€” bridging computer graphics, GPU acceleration, and clinical visualization.

Current Research
GPU-Accelerated Medical Visualization System
Developing hardware-driven pipelines for real-time 3D reconstruction of large-scale lung CT data.
Focus Areas:

Real-time volumetric rendering with VTK and OpenGL
Memory-optimized GPU pipelines for clinical datasets
Adaptive LOD and texel density management
Automated segmentation using morphological techniques
